# Chatroom

Implementation of a multithreaded chatroom. Base code for future online multiplayer game.

Future ideas include:
  - Handling multiple rooms in the server
  - Setting roles for each user
  - Fix multiple bugs that come with forcefully terminating the Server
  - Various commands allowing user to send/recieve files
  - Allow user to send message to 1 specific client
